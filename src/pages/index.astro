			<h1>Hello, friend!</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Christopher Gikas and this this website is mostly for having a central spot for my stuff and allow people to find me easily!
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently the Head of Devops & Security at Grubmarket and previously worked at Oportun pre-IPO as a Junior Devops Engineer and
				ending my career there as a Senior Devops Engineer of a public company. I enjoy bringing companies public and helping them meet SOX,
				SOC2, PCI needs along with improving and creating platforms to be productive and meet business needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't have much of a social media presence so this is my attempt at having one!
